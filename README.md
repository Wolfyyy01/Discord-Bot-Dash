# Discord Bot Page

Here there is only a landing page, not complete like a dashboard, or other pages.

You can change every word in the html file (change the text and your bot name in index.html)

You can also use this landing page for other purposes, but with credits

# Installation

Just clone or download or fork the repo and open index.html

# I use:
